Here is my 2 columns, 3 colums, and Image Gallery assignment.
I really wanted to understand this and really wanted to work on composition, code and design at the same time.

Sorry it took so long but this is one of the only ways I can take to learn code is to put into a real life 
example so I Can understand when I go back into it.

1. Fixed social media icon took me forever to figure out. The code was borrowed from many tutorials and I edited it but I wanted to
show that I understand how to control and place into the body of my HTML document. I am also using web icons for this but
for some reason they do not show up in the end result. I had to create a work around so that the twitter and FB icons
appear on top of the slide buttons. I would like this to be better but it got the job done. 

As for the 2 and 3 colums those are pretty simple and straightforward. AFter understanding the 2 columns with min and max
width. The logic behing making 3 columns came easy.

The Gallery was used from the article references and just edited the code so that it is more image heavy. 
I wanted to figure out the captions for the thumbnails. Can you please show me how to do this properly? When I place 
my columns go hay-wire.
Thanks
